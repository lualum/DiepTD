# Project: Expanded Diep.io in tower defense form

# Instructions for Playing:
Go to (https://lualum.github.io/DiepTD/) to play the game.

# Gameplay:
This is a tower defense game where your objective is to strategically place tanks on the battlefield to stop waves of oncoming enemies. Each tank you deploy acts as a defense unit, targeting and attacking enemies automatically within its range.

**Placing Tanks:** Click on the available tanks listed on the right-hand side of the screen. Then, click on a tile on the game board to place the selected tank. You’ll need to have enough XP (experience points) to place a tank — each type has its own XP cost (shown on bottom).

**Earning Money:** You earn money by destroying enemies (the shapes) that move across the gray path. Stronger enemies grant more money when defeated. 

**Tank Stats:**
- Cost: The amount of XP required to place the tank on the board. More powerful tanks typically cost more, so spend your XP wisely.
- Range: How far the tank can shoot from its current position. Tanks with longer range can cover larger areas and begin attacking enemies earlier as they approach.
- Damage: The amount of health the tank removes from an enemy with each successful hit. Higher damage tanks are great for taking down tougher enemies quickly.
- Reload Speed: The time it takes between each shot. Tanks with faster reload speeds can fire more frequently, making them effective against swarms of weaker enemies.
